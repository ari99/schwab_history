 This project allows you to combine Schwab statement pdf's with the history csv available via download, which allows you to 
 have access to a much longer time frame of transaction data in a combined csv. The Schwab history download has a shorter
 date range than the Schwab statements available, but the statements are in pdf, not in a usable format. You can use
 your transaction history for comparing your manual Schwab trading with an algorithmically traded backtest.
